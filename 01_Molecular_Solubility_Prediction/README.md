## 📖 Project Overview

This project predicts the aqueous solubility (`logS`) of molecules using Machine Learning regression models.

Molecular solubility is an important physicochemical property in chemistry and pharmaceutical research — it helps determine whether a molecule has potential as a drug candidate, since poorly soluble compounds are harder to formulate and test.

This project marks an important milestone in my Machine Learning journey. Rather than just training a model and stopping, my goal was to understand the full workflow of a regression problem — from loading the dataset to evaluating and improving model performance.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the end-to-end Machine Learning workflow for regression problems.
- Compare how different regression models perform on the same dataset.
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics.
- Improve model performance through Hyperparameter Tuning.
- Practice documenting a Machine Learning project as part of my portfolio.

## 📂 Dataset

**Dataset:** [ESOL / Delaney Solubility Dataset](https://github.com/dataprofessor/data/blob/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv) — 1,144 molecules with precomputed descriptors.

**Target variable**
- `logS` — aqueous solubility

**Input features**

| Feature | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MolLogP` | Octanol-water partition coefficient (lipophilicity) |
| `MolWt` | Molecular weight |
| `NumRotatableBonds` | Molecular flexibility |
| `AromaticProportion` | Proportion of aromatic atoms in the molecule |

## 🤖 Models Used

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| Linear Regression | Simple baseline regression model |
| Random Forest (baseline) | Ensemble model, shallow depth (`max_depth=2`) |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | Same model, optimized via `RandomizedSearchCV` |

## 📊 Results

| Model | Train MSE | Train R² | Test MSE | Test R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Linear Regression | 1.008 | 0.765 | 1.021 | 0.789 |
| Random Forest (baseline) | 1.028 | 0.760 | 1.408 | 0.709 |
| **Random Forest (Tuned)** | **0.303** | **0.929** | **0.676** | **0.860** |

### Key Findings

- Linear Regression provided a solid, simple baseline.
- The shallow-depth baseline Random Forest actually **underperformed** Linear Regression on the test set — a reminder that Random Forest isn't automatically better without proper tuning.
- After applying `RandomizedSearchCV` (5-fold CV, 50 iterations), the tuned Random Forest achieved the best performance by a clear margin (Test R² 0.860 vs. 0.789).
- **Takeaway:** hyperparameter tuning mattered more here than the choice of algorithm itself.

## 💾 Model Persistence & Inference

After identifying the best-performing model using **RandomizedSearchCV**, the tuned Random Forest model was serialized using Python's `pickle` module.

The saved model was then loaded back into memory and used to perform predictions on unseen test samples. This demonstrates a simple **Machine Learning inference workflow**, where a trained model can be reused without retraining.

### Example Inference

| Actual logS | Predicted logS |
|------------:|---------------:|
| -3.38 | -3.084 |
| -8.01 | -8.167 |
| -2.16 | -1.992 |
| -1.17 | -1.531 |
| -0.73 | -0.492 |

This verifies that the serialized model can successfully perform inference after being reloaded.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

Being upfront about where this project stands right now:

- No EDA yet — missing values, feature distributions, and correlations between features (e.g. `MolLogP` vs `MolWt`) haven't been checked.
- No data cleaning/preprocessing step; the dataset is used as-is.
- Model comparison relies on a single 80/20 train-test split rather than cross-validated scores across all models.
- No baseline (dummy regressor) to show how much better these models are than simply guessing the average.
- The Random Forest "baseline" uses a shallow depth rather than scikit-learn's true default, so it isn't a fully fair pre-tuning comparison.

I'm treating these as the next things to fix — see [Future Improvements](#-future-improvements).

## 📉 Visualizations

Prediction plots (predicted vs. experimental logS) for each model are available in the `images/` folder:

## 🚀 Beyond the Original Tutorial

This project was initially developed by following the tutorial below, up to the **Prediction Visualization** stage.

To deepen my understanding, I continued experimenting independently by adding:

- `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- Tuned model evaluation and comparison
- Updated results table and documentation

These additions helped me understand *why* model optimization improves performance, not just *that* it does.

## 💡 What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned:

- How to build regression models using scikit-learn.
- How to compare multiple regression algorithms.
- How to evaluate regression models using MSE and R² Score.
- How to improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- How to save trained Machine Learning models using the `pickle` module.
- How to reload a saved model and perform inference on unseen data.
- How to document a Machine Learning project professionally for a GitHub portfolio.

More importantly, this project taught me that building a model isn't just about chasing better metrics — it's about understanding *why* a model performs the way it does, and being honest about what's still missing.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Sincere thanks to **Data Professor** for creating high-quality educational content and making Machine Learning more accessible to beginners. This project follows that tutorial as a starting point, then extends it independently with hyperparameter tuning, additional evaluation, and improved documentation as part of my own learning journey.
